### Project Overview:
Our goal with the "OUSL Colombo Navigation Application" is to create a user-friendly, intuitive mobile app designed specifically for students and faculty at [the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) in Colombo.](https://ou.ac.lk/) This application aims to streamline the navigation experience within the campus, making it easier for users to find their way around, access essential information, and enhance their overall experience at OUSL.

### Key Technologies:
React Native: We chose React Native to build a cross-platform mobile application that can run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices. This technology allows us to develop a single codebase, resulting in greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### JavaScript:
JavaScript is the core programming language that powers our application. It enables us to create interactive, dynamic, and responsive user interfaces, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Features:
Our application will offer a range of features, including:

Interactive campus maps with real-time location tracking.
Information about various campus facilities, such as classrooms, libraries, and administrative offices.
Event calendars and announcements to keep users informed about upcoming activities and important updates.
Contact information for faculty and staff, making it easy for users to get in touch.
A user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation to provide a seamless user experience.
Collaboration:
We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the OUSL community and the open-source development community. Feel free to submit pull requests, report issues, or share your ideas to help us improve and expand the functionality of the OUSL Colombo Navigation Application.

Join us in our mission to enhance the OUSL Colombo experience with this innovative mobile app. Let's make navigation on campus more convenient and enjoyable for everyone!
